This course is going to use GitHub Pages to create your website. To initialize GitHub Pages we need to perform a few more steps:

1. With your repository created, click the **Settings** tab.
1. On the Options section (default information displayed), scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
1. Click **Choose a theme**.
1. Decide which theme you would like to use, and click **Select theme**.

      *Note: If you don't like the themes available, later in the course we identify how you can build a website without using a GitHub Pages theme.* 

1. Accept the filler text by scrolling to the bottom of the page and click on **Commit Changes**.
1. Your site is published at: `USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME`.
