It's time to create the home page for your website.

1. Make sure you are checked out to the new branch you just created. You change branches by clicking the **Current Branch** button at the top of the application, then selecting a branch.

The next steps are determined by if you used a GitHub Pages theme or decided to just enable GitHub Pages on your repository.

### I am using a GitHub Pages theme

1. Open the file named `README.md`.
1. Remove the template text that was added to the `README.md` when you selected your theme.
1. In the `README.md` file include at least the following two lines: `# Hello World!` and `My name is GITHUB_USERNAME`. Bonus points for including more information.
1. When you are finished, save your changes and close the text editor.

### I am not using a GitHub Pages theme

1. Create a new file named `index.html`.
1. In your `index.html` file, include at least the following two lines: `<h1> Hello World! </h1>` and `<p> My name is GITHUB_USERNAME </p>`. Bonus points for including more information, or using [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) to create a more robust site.
1. When you are finished, save your file inside your repository folder, and close the text editor.
