  Now, earlier in the course, we recommended that you take our [Intro to GitHub Course](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/).

  Now, we're dedicating a whole page to stress how important it is that you do that. The last thing we want is for you to be overwhelmed with GitHub/Git AND how to make a contribution at the same time.

  If you have a good understanding of a GitHub repository, let's carry on.
