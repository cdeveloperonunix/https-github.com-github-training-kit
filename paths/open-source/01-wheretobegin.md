  Okay, so what _is_ Open Source?

  > When a project is open source, that means that anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.<sup>[source](http://opensource.guide/beginners-guide/)</sup>

  Where to start? Figure out the way you'd like to contribute. Then, think about your interests.

  ### Step One (Ways to Contribute)
  More detail/guidance on this section can be found in **Open Sources** below.

  - Do you like planning events?
  - Do you like to design?
  - Do you like to write?
  - Do you like organizing?
  - Do you like to code?
  - Do you like helping people?
  - Do you like helping others code?

  ### Step Two (Interests)

  - List 3-5 websites that you enjoy spending time on.

  WARNING: Large bunch of text incoming, but it's all helpful and excellent. [Source Here](http://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/#what-it-means-to-contribute).

  ### Do you like planning events?

  * Organize workshops or meetups about the project, [like @fzamperin did for NodeSchool](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues/406)
  * Organize the project's conference (if they have one)
  * Help community members find the right conferences and submit proposals for speaking

  ### Do you like to design?

  * Improve the website's layout or visual design
  * Make a new logo for the project, [like hapi.js's contributors did](https://github.com/hapijs/contrib/issues/68)
  * Rethink the project's onboarding experience, for new users or contributors
  * Redesign the newsletter

  ### Do you like to write?

  * Write and improve the project's documentation
  * Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used
  * Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list
  * Write tutorials for the project, [like pypa's contributors did](https://github.com/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/issues/194)
  * Write a translation for the project's documentation

  ### Do you like organizing?

  * Link to duplicate issues, and suggest new issue labels, to keep things organized
  * Go through open issues and suggest closing old ones, [like @nzakas did for eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6765)
  * Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward

  ### Do you like to code?

  * Find an open issue to tackle, [like @dianjin did for Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/4528#issuecomment-216520560)
  * Ask if you can help write a new feature
  * Automate project setup
  * Improve tooling and testing

  ### Do you like helping people?

  * Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow ([like this Postgres example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-trying-to-ge)) or reddit
  * Answer questions for people on open issues
  * Help moderate the discussion boards or conversation channels

  ### Do you like helping others code?

  * Review code on other people's submissions
  * Write tutorials for how a project can be used
  * Offer to mentor another contributor, [like @ereichert did for @bronzdoc on Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/123#issuecomment-238049666)

  ### You don't just have to work on software projects!

  While "open source" often refers to software, you can collaborate on just about anything. There are books, recipes, lists, and classes that get developed as open source projects.

  For example:

  * @sindresorhus curates a [list of "awesome" lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
  * @jwasham created a [study plan](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) for self-taught developers to get a corporate software engineer interview
  * @h5bp maintains a [list of potential interview questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) for front-end developer candidates
  * @stuartlynn and @nicole-a-tesla made a [collection of fun facts about puffins](https://github.com/stuartlynn/puffin_facts)

  Even if you're a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It's often less intimidating to work on projects that don't involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.
